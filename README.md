# Simple Static Site

This workspace now contains a small static website you can open locally.

Files added/updated:

- `index.html` — The site's main HTML page.
- `styles.css` — Basic responsive styles.
- `javascript.js` — Small scripts (nav toggle, year, form handling). Existing console.log was preserved.

How to open:

- Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click the file or open from VS Code).

Notes:

- The contact form is simulated and does not send data anywhere. Replace the submit handler to integrate a backend or service.
- You can edit any of the files to customize content, styles, or behavior.
